## Usage

The game timer starts as soon as the user presses the "start quiz" button. Each question contains one picture of a dog and the user has to guess which breed it is by pressing one of the buttons corresponding to the breed name. If the user gets an incorrect answer, then the timer will decrease by 15 seconds. After the last question, the user will be taken to a game over screen to input their name to the leaderboard. This will then display their name and their score. If the user does not make it to the last question within the time limit, they will be taken directly to the game over screen.
